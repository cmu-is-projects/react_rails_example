# This is using the gem react on rails
* url: https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails
* I only got this to work on mac, followed the instructions as close as possible, here https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md
* this did not work on ubuntu, bad server side rendering
* The jsx files are in client/app/bundles/calendar/components
* components must be registered in client/app/bundles/calendar/startup
* You need to use foreman to run this to get the server side rendering portion of this to work
